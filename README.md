## Description: 
loop machine is an HTML application that uses JavaScript & css that gives the user the ability to mix several different sounds into one audio.
The app includes nine buttons of different sounds (each button represents a sound) and four more buttons of Play, Stop, Record, and PlaySession.
## Manual:
Clicking on the sound button will change its state (OFF to ON or ON to OFF). 
Clicking on the play button will start to play all the sounds whose buttons are in the ON state. During the play, you can add more sounds by clicking on their button and changing the state from OFF to ON. All sounds will be played in a repeat loop as long as their button is in the ON state.
Clicking on the stop button will stop playing all the sounds and return the buttons to their OFF position.
Clicking on the record button will immediately start recording the session and once more clicking on the record button will stop recording. 
After the session is recorded, clicking on the playSession button will play it.
